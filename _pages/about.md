<span style="color:red">__<font size="+2">I am applying for tenure-track faculty positions this season.</font>__</span>

I'm a PhD candidate from the EECS department at the University of Michigan. I work with my research advisor [Prof. Kevin Fu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/) at the Security And Privacy Research Group ([SPQR](https://spqrlab1.github.io/)). I completed my B.E. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en).  

My research is broadly in cyber-physical system (CPS) security and spans the intersections of embedded system security, sensing, and mobile computing. Specifically, I seek to ensure trustworthy and confidential sensing  in user-device interactions, critical infrastructures, and emerging technologies, with a focus on the hardware-software interfaces. 


<!-- with a focus on the following topics: 
* The gaps between existing computation abstractions and actual hardware/software implementations in embedded sensing systems.
* The techniques for using existing sensors to extract extra modalities of signals using data-driven approaches informed by sensor physics.
* The downstream security and privacy problems as well as the new opportunities in biometric data collection and digital forensics.  -->



## News


* **[Sep 15, 2023]** My paper EM Eye is accepted at NDSS'24 without revisions (35 papers accepted out of 483 submitted, top 7.2%). We demonstrate how attackers may visually spy on households by analyzing side-channel EM leakage of smart home cameras owned by the victim. __Demos will be put up soon!__   
* [Aug 15, 2023] I am very excited to contribute to the First International Workshop on Security and Privacy of Sensing Systems [(Sensors S&P 2023, co-located with SenSys)](https://sensorssp.github.io/sensorssp23/) as a program committee member. Please see the CFP and consider joining us in Istanbul!   
* [July 19, 2023] I will be serving on the technical program committee of the 19th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking [(MSN 2023)](https://ieee-msn.org/2023/). The paper submission deadline is Aug 5. Please consider submitting your works here!  
* [June 22, 2023] Our paper on keyboard sensing security conditionally accepted at [NDSS 2024](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/). 
* [June 16, 2023] One co-first authored paper on Android sensor security conditionally accepted at [RAID 2023](https://raid2023.org/welcome.html). 
* [April 10, 2023] Our website for the [Side Eye project](https://sideeyeattack.github.io/Website/) is up. Check out the speech samples extracted from muted videos! 
* [Mar 27, 2023] Our position paper on [satellite security threat modeling](/files/spacesec23.pdf) is invited to be presented at [CySat 2023](https://cysat.eu/) in Paris.  
* [Mar 3, 2023] I am honored to receive the [Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/stories/yan-long-awarded-predoctoral-fellowship-to-support-research-impacting-secure-communications)! 
* [Feb 27, 2023] We presented our position paper on future sensor spoofing threats against satellites systems in [the first Space Security Workshop](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-program/spacesec-2023/).
