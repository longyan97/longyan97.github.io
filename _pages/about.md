My research is broadly in cyber-physical system (CPS) security and privacy and spans the intersections of embedded systems, sensing, and mobile computing. I seek to ensure **trustworthy and confidential sensing-based computation** in user-device interactions, critical infrastructures, and emerging technologies, with a focus on the hardware-software interfaces. I received my PhD degree from the [University of Michigan, EECS](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/). I am currently working with my PhD advisor [Prof. Kevin Fu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/) (Fellow of IEEE, ACM, AAAS) at the Security And Privacy Research Group ([SPQR](https://spqrlab1.github.io/)). I completed my B.E. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en).  

<span style="color:rgb(231, 76, 60)">__<font size="+1">[Call For Papers]</font>__</span> Prof. Wayne Burleson and I are editing a Special Issue, [Sensors in Hardware Security](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/58QBF63WFW), with the Sensors journal. The special issue seeks to highlight solid research on how to use sensors for hardware security and how to protect sensing. Please check out the special issue website and consider submitting your work before May 2025! 


<span style="color:rgb(231, 76, 60)">__<font size="+1">[Recruiting PhD Students and Interns]</font>__</span> We are always seeking talented students who are passionate about tackling research challenges in computer security and sensing. We welcome both in-person and remote interns. For more information about our team, [check out this](./team/).

### Research Interests


* Protecting user privacy from evolving sensors ([IEEE S&P'23](/files/oakland23-privateeye.pdf), [RAID'23](/files/raid23.pdf)) and side-channel problems ([IEEE S&P'23](https://sideeyeattack.github.io/Website/), [NDSS'24](https://emeyeattack.github.io/Website/))
* Modeling the security impact of physcial signals such as acoustics, lasers, electromagentic interference on computer vision ([VehicleSec'24](/files/vehiclesec24.pdf)), speech processing ([IEEE S&P'24](/files/oakland24.pdf)), and other sensing systems ([NDSS'24](https://sites.google.com/view/ghosttype-demo))  
* Designing novel sensing software and hardware systems for security ([ACM CCS'19](/files/ccs19.pdf), [ACM NSPW'22](/files/nspw22.pdf)) and healthcare ([UbiComp/IMWUT'21](https://spqrlab1.github.io/N95deconProject.html)) 
* Sensing-related security and privacy problems in Android, AR/VR, and other emerging mobile computing platforms, as well as DeepFake multimedia.  

<!-- with a focus on the following topics: 
* The gaps between existing computation abstractions and actual hardware/software implementations in embedded sensing systems.
* The techniques for using existing sensors to extract extra modalities of signals using data-driven approaches informed by sensor physics.
* The downstream security and privacy problems as well as the new opportunities in biometric data collection and digital forensics.  -->
