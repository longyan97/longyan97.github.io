I am expected to graduate from my PhD program in early 2024. I am actively looking for jobs as a tenure-track faculty in computing and security. 

I would love to hear from you for any collaboration opportunity and questions! Please feel free to reach out to me at <a href = "mailto: yanlong@umich.edu">yanlong at umich dot edu</a>
