My research is broadly in cyber-physical system (CPS) security and privacy and spans the intersections of embedded systems, sensing, and mobile computing. I seek to ensure **trustworthy and confidential sensing-based computation** in user-device interactions, critical infrastructures, and emerging technologies, with a focus on the hardware-software interfaces. I received my PhD degree from the [University of Michigan, EECS](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) where I worked with my PhD advisor [Kevin Fu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/) (Fellow of IEEE, ACM, AAAS). I completed my undergraduate study at Zhejiang University, where I worked with [Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (Fellow of IEEE) and [Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en). 
My research has been recognized by the [IEEE S&P Distinguished Paper Award](https://sp2024.ieee-security.org/awards.html), [CPS Rising Stars Award](https://risingstars.linklab.virginia.edu/2024/participants/yan-long.html), and [IEEE HOST Best PhD Thesis Award](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/stories/yan-long-receives-dissertation-award-in-the-area-of-hardware-security), and reported by [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/creepy-tool-lets-criminal-hackers-access-home-video-cameras), [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/anywhere-theres-a-camera-now-theres-a-risk-billions-of-users-at-risk-of-peeping-toms-scientists-devise-incredibly-simple-eavesdropping-system-costing-only-a-few-hundred-dollars), [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/17/glasses_reflections_zoom/), etc.

### Research Interests

* Protecting user privacy from evolving sensors ([IEEE S&P'23](/files/oakland23-privateeye.pdf), [RAID'23](/files/raid23.pdf)) and side-channel problems ([IEEE S&P'23](https://sideeyeattack.github.io/Website/), [NDSS'24](https://emeyeattack.github.io/Website/))
* Modeling the security impact of physcial signals such as acoustics, lasers, electromagentic interference on computer vision ([RAID'25](/files/raid25-rfeyed.pdf), [VehicleSec'24](/files/vehiclesec24.pdf)), speech processing ([IEEE S&P'24](/files/oakland24.pdf)), and other sensing systems ([NDSS'24](https://sites.google.com/view/ghosttype-demo))  
* Designing novel sensing software and hardware systems for security ([ACM CCS'19](/files/ccs19.pdf), [ACM NSPW'22](/files/nspw22.pdf)) and healthcare ([UbiComp/IMWUT'21](https://spqrlab1.github.io/N95deconProject.html)) 
* Sensing-related security and privacy problems in Android ([WiSec'25](/files/wisec25-armour.pdf)), AR/VR, and other emerging mobile computing platforms, as well as DeepFake multimedia.  

<!-- with a focus on the following topics: 
* The gaps between existing computation abstractions and actual hardware/software implementations in embedded sensing systems.
* The techniques for using existing sensors to extract extra modalities of signals using data-driven approaches informed by sensor physics.
* The downstream security and privacy problems as well as the new opportunities in biometric data collection and digital forensics.  -->
