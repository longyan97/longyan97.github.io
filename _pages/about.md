I'm a 4th year PhD candidate from the EECS department at the University of Michigan. I work with my research advisor [Prof. Kevin Fu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/) at the Security And Privacy Research Group ([SPQR](https://spqrlab1.github.io/)). I completed my B.E. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en).  My research spans the intersections of embedded system security, sensing, and mobile computing, with a focus on the following topics: 
* The gaps between existing computation abstractions and actual hardware/software implementations in embedded sensing systems.
* The techniques for using existing sensors to extract extra modalities of signals using data-driven approaches informed by sensor physics.
* The downstream security and privacy problems as well as the new opportunities in biometric data collection and digital forensics.
