I am expected to graduate from my PhD program in early 2024. I am actively looking for jobs as faculty, post-doc researcher, and industrial R&D in the areas of security, sensing, and mobile health computing. 

I would love to hear from you for any collaboration opportunity and questions! Please feel free to reach out to me at [yanlong at umich dot edu](yanlong@umich.edu).
