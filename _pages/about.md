My research is broadly in cyber-physical system (CPS) security and privacy and spans the intersections of embedded systems, sensing, and mobile computing. I seek to ensure **trustworthy and confidential sensing-based computation** in user-device interactions, critical infrastructures, and emerging technologies, with a focus on the hardware-software interfaces. I received my PhD degree from the [University of Michigan, EECS](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/). I am currently working with my PhD advisor [Prof. Kevin Fu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/) at the Security And Privacy Research Group ([SPQR](https://spqrlab1.github.io/)). I completed my B.E. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en).  



<span style="color:rgb(231, 76, 60)">__<font size="+1">[Recruiting PhD Students and Interns]</font>__</span> I am joining the [Computer Science Department of the University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science) as an assistant professor starting August 2025, and have multiple PhD openings in the application season of fall 2024. If you are interested in working with me as PhD students or undergrad/grad interns, I encourage you to [use this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxbOr8iBbGeKrfdWzBFqdF-GASDRhi94EGK9xUv4zQso4ioA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to get in touch. 



<!-- with a focus on the following topics: 
* The gaps between existing computation abstractions and actual hardware/software implementations in embedded sensing systems.
* The techniques for using existing sensors to extract extra modalities of signals using data-driven approaches informed by sensor physics.
* The downstream security and privacy problems as well as the new opportunities in biometric data collection and digital forensics.  -->
